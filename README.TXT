The original info file (MISC.TXT) was created for the university staff that rated
and tested our game when it was released (see below) and is therefore in German
and might not be of too much interest anyway. You might try feeding the Google Language
Tool (www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en) with it if you're interested, though, which
yields incredibly acceptable results ;)

INFO
----

Possible Worlds is an openGL-accelerated 3D game that was created in the course of
a Computer Graphics lab exercise (www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/CG23/HallOfFame.html)
at the Technical University of Vienna (www.tuwien.ac.at)
It won the competition for the best game hands down and we originally intended to develop
Possible Worlds even further with a network-multiplayer mode, more visual FX, etc..
Unfortunately, neither of us could be very much bothered to work on it any more in the
Summer holidays, probably because we were a bit burned out by the great amount of work
that was necessary to create this game in less than four months. Once university started
again in October 2001, we again had a lot of things to do at university and could not
get around to enhance Possible Worlds, so we decided we'd finally open-source our work
without all the enhancements we'd planned.

We regret the development stop but we think the sourcecode might still be of interest
for quite a few people, although it might not be beautifully written at times ;)
That said, I still intend to do small updates on Possible Worlds, I'd still love
to see the caustics effect in action and I think the cockpit could use some enhanced
HUD too... and MORE MISSIONS!
A lot of people have emailed us about implementing Joystick or mouse support or other
minor changes. Now that Possible Worlds is open source, just grab the SDL-docs 
(www.libsdl.org) and this should be a matter of a few minutes. I don't like PC joysticks
much (they're crap for racing games) and I haven't got one, that's why joy support wasn't 
in the game all along.

Actually, I'm starting to think about my next project which will most likely be some kind 
of a fast 3D multiplayer game incorporating sheep and a mechanical wolf. Erm, yes :)


Finally, we want to thank you for playing our creation and hope you have as much fun
playing the game or browsing the source as we had writing it. We received quite a lot of
feedback and rave reviews at various gaming sites that made the whole thing worth it!

By the way, this is just an incomplete list of web sites that featured Possible Worlds.
There are probably many more, but these I recorded some time ago.
