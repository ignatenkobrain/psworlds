			Compiling/Installing Possible Worlds


General note:

Possible Worlds is designed for SDL Version 1.2.0 and FMOD Version 3.33
Since FMOD 3.33 isn't available at www.fmod.org anymore, all Version 3.33 files needed
to compile and run are included in this distribution.
www.libsdl.org keeps an archive of all older versions, so you shouldn't have any
problems with getting version 1.2.0




Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2k/XP
=======================================================================

you can either compile the game for yourself or just play the precompiled version.


Playing the precompiled version
-------------------------------

1) download "psworlds-exe-win.zip" from the Possible Worlds download site and unzip.
2) locate the file "/psworlds/psworlds.exe" and double-click it.



Compiling Possible Worlds for Windows
-------------------------------------

1) download the SDL library from www.libsdl.org
2) download GLUT from http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html


3) copy header files
--------------------

place the files

fmod/inc/fmod.h
fmod/inc/wincompat.h
glut/glut.h

in your compiler's include-dir, for Visual C++ 6.0 this is Devstudio/VC98/include

create a sub-dir Devstudio/VC98/include/SDL and place all the files from SDL/include there


4) copy libs
------------

place the files

fmod/lib/fmodvc.lib
SDL/lib/SDL.lib
SDL/lib/SDLmain.lib
glut/glut32.lib

in your compiler's lib-dir, for Visual C++ 6.0 this is Devstudio/VC98/lib


5) copy DLLs
------------

place the files

fmod/fmod.dll
SDL/lib/SDL.dll
glut/glut32.dll

in you windows system folder
under win9x this should be C:\windows\System, under winNT/2k/XP C:\WINNT\System32


6) compile
----------

open the project workspace psworlds.dsw and compile.
the executable "psworlds.exe" will be placed in the parent directory (/psworlds)






Linux / Unixish systems
=========================================================================

1) If you don't have it already, download the SDL library from www.libsdl.org 
   (SDL development library package AND the Runtime libraries)
   as far as i know, SDL installs its headers in a subdir named usr/include/SDL, if it
   doesn't, please create the directory yourself and copy the headers there.
2) download and install the MESA3D library (www.mesa3d.org), which is the linux openGL 
   equivalent (mesa3d is included in most linux distributions and most likely already 
   installed on your system)



3) compile & run
----------------

enter directory psworlds/source and type "make", ignoring all warnings. 
the binary "psworlds-linux" will be located in the parent directory (/psworlds)
start the game there by launching the shell script ./psworlds-run.sh
